Monitor A Non-Standard Port with check_tcp
==========================================

Exercise Introduction
---------------------

Monitor the state of a specific TCP/UDP port on a network connected device, and notify you if it stops responding: tell if your local blockchain node has stopped responding on port 8333, Apache2 has stopped responding on port 443, or monitor the state of openssh running on your server on port 22. These are just examples. The options are limitless.
