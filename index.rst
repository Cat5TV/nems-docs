Introduction
------------

The NEMS Linux documentation is a work in progress, and we are actively
going through the pages to find errors, out of date information, and
missing images since moving to our new documentation system. If you
find any problems or inconsistencies, please either provide a pull
request on GitHub, file an issue on GitHub, or contact us on Discord.

Support
-------

As NEMS Linux continues to grow, our support options are also evolving. At present, there are a few key points to keep in mind when seeking support:

#. NEMS Linux is a community-driven project, so the best place to start is usually the community. We offer an `official Discord server <https://discord.gg/e9xT9mh>`__ and a `Community Forum <https://forum.nemslinux.com>`__ to help you find what you need.
#. Our lead developer, Robbie Ferguson (*RobbieF#7136*), is often available via our Discord server. That is the best place to reach him directly.
#. Among other perks, users who choose to `support NEMS Linux on Patreon <https://patreon.com/nems>`__ gain access to Patron-exclusive rooms on our Discord server, including #priority-support, which are setup to ding lead developer, Robbie Ferguson, on his phone. So in cases where priority support is required, he's usually quite good to reply promptly.
